##Project description##
The [MyCyFAPP project](http://www.mycyfapp.eu/en/) is concerned with helping people who suffer from cystic fibrosis. This piece of software is the back-end of a suite intended to help people remember taking their medicine, as well as allowing parents or guardians to overview this process. This server was made for the course IT2901 at [NTNU](http://www.ntnu.no) for the Norwegian research organisation [SINTEF](http://www.sintef.no).

This is the back-end server for the Android app [FamiliMedicineReminderClient](https://github.com/SINTEF-SIT/familyMedicineReminderClient).
